header_headline: Welcome
header_subheadline: We provide the answer to the age old question “What do you
  want to do today?”. Our ‘Pop up Paint and Sip’ classes make it a fun and easy
  way to catch up with friends.   We set out to create unique art events where
  you get to paint the little luxuries in life. Unlike most sip and paint
  classes we specialise in water colours to create painted keepsakes that you
  will actually want to display in your home!  Are you still reading and worried
  that you've never painted before? Well don’t shy away from a good day/night
  just yet because these classes have been designed to be accessible for the
  absolute beginner to the intermediate artist with our step by step guidance.
  By the end of a Boujee Brush class you will be ready to take on a three year
  art degree… well at least until the prosecco wears off. We run both public and
  private social events. To book a spot into our latest public classes check out
  the links below or on our socials. To book a private class then send us a
  message from our contact page or on instagram.  Looking forward to hanging out
  with you for some boujee fun!
