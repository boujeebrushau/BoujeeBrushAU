## WORK WITH US

Want extra revenue for your business? Host a Boujee Brush Paint session at your venue! This is not only going to bring new customers to your establishment but will engage existing patrons. During our 2-3 hour session you can boost sales with food and beverages. Great way to increase sales during off peak operating times. 

If it's a unique marketing solution youâ€™re after then we can create a customised watercolour painting specific for your venue, event or product launch. 

How does the collaboration work?

You provide the venue and we provide the experience.

- We ask for you to provide an area in your establishment for the class to be held. 
- We will bring everything needed for the 2-3 hour Boujee Brush experience to your establishment.
- We will charge the customers pp through Eventbite for the experience.
You sell the food and drinks before, during or after the class. 
- We both advertise on our social media leading up to the event to maximise participation.
