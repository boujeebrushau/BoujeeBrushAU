## PRIVATE CLASSES 

Bespoke experience for any occasion!

Have an event you want to celebrate but not sure what to do?  We offer private group painting classes where we come to you!  Whether it's your home, or you already have a venue in mind, our host will arrive with everything provided for your Boujee Brush experience. The best part?  Prior to the event our artist will work with you to create a unique design for you and your guests!

That is the important part, right? You want to know what I can do for you. This is why I put this right up there into the header menu of the website.

Wow. That was nice, right? Well, call me and let us talk.

design for you and your guests!

Want to split the bill? No problem! We will set up a convenient link for your guests to purchase their own spot for your event. Guests must purchase tickets 10 days prior to the event.
