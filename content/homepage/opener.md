Welcome to Boujee Brush!

We provide the answer to the age old question “What do you want to do today?”. Our ‘Pop up Paint and Sip’ classes make it a fun and easy way to catch up with friends. 

We set out to create unique art events where you get to paint the little luxuries in life. Unlike most sip and paint classes we specialise in water colours, not acrylic paint to create beautiful keepsakes for your home. Are you still reading and worried that you've never painted before? Well don’t shy away from a good night just yet because these classes have been designed to be accessible for the absolute beginner to the intermediate artist with our step by step guidance. 

We run both public and private social events, these can be found here or on our socials so come and join us for some boujee fun!
